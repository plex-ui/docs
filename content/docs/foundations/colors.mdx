description: Primitive color palettes available in Plex UI
---

Plex UI defines a set of primitive color palettes that underpin every component. These palettes are exposed as CSS custom properties and are designed to work seamlessly with light and dark modes. Use semantic tokens (e.g. `text-primary`, `bg-surface`) in your own components rather than referencing specific palette values directly.
