title: Design Tokens
description: Explore available tokens from Plex UI
---

Plex UI ships a set of CSS custom properties (design tokens) that drive all visual styling — spacing, radii, shadows, and more. Use these tokens in your own components to stay consistent with the system. Each token maps to a `var(--plex-*)` custom property that you can reference in Tailwind classes or plain CSS.

<div className="not-prose">
  <DesignTokens />
</div>
