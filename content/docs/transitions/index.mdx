Plex UI includes a set of transition primitives for animating component lifecycle — entering, exiting, and layout changes. Pick a high-level component for common cases, or drop down to a low-level primitive for full control.

## High-level components

- [**Animate**](/docs/transitions/animate) — Batteries-included enter/exit transitions (opacity, scale, blur, etc.) for fixed-size or absolutely positioned elements.
- [**Animate Layout**](/docs/transitions/animate-layout) — Like Animate, but also animates the container's height or width so surrounding layout reflows smoothly.
- [**Animate Layout Group**](/docs/transitions/animate-layout-group) — Like Animate Layout, but designed for lists where items enter and exit dynamically.

## Low-level primitives

- [**Transition Group**](/docs/transitions/transition-group) — Controls mount/unmount timing and exposes data attributes for custom CSS transitions. Use when the high-level components don't fit your needs.
- [**Slot Transition Group**](/docs/transitions/slot-transition-group) — Same as Transition Group but applies data attributes directly to children instead of adding a wrapper element.
