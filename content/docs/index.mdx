Plex UI is a modern design system for building high-quality applications, providing styling foundations with Tailwind, CSS variable design tokens, and a library of well-crafted, accessible components. Plex UI includes:

- **Design tokens** – for colors, typography, spacing, sizing, shadows, surfaces, and more.
- **Tailwind 4** – pre-configured with Plex UI's design tokens.
- **Component library** – high-quality components built on top of Radix for consistent accessibility patterns.
- **Utilities** – for dark mode, responsiveness layouts, and more.
