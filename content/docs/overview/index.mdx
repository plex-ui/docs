## Plex UI

A production-grade design system for building high-quality applications — based on the same design foundations as [OpenAI's Apps SDK UI](https://github.com/openai/apps-sdk-ui), the component library used inside **ChatGPT**. Styling foundations with Tailwind 4, CSS variable design tokens, and a library of well-crafted, accessible components — all with pixel-perfect Figma parity.

### Why Plex UI

**Battle-tested at scale** — Plex UI components are based on the same design system that powers ChatGPT, a product used by hundreds of millions. These aren't theoretical components designed in isolation — they've been validated in one of the most used products on the planet.

**9 sizes, not 4** — Most component libraries offer 3–4 size options per control. Plex UI provides a unified **9-step size scale** (22px to 48px) across all key controls — Button, Input, Select, SelectControl, and SegmentedControl. From compact controls for data-dense dashboards to spacious hero CTAs, one `size` prop scales everything consistently.

**Figma-to-code parity** — Every size variant, every color, every design token exists identically in both the Figma kit and the React component library. No translation gaps. No manual adjustments. Design in Figma, build in code — they match 1:1.

### What's included

- **Design tokens** — Colors, typography, spacing, sizing, shadows, surfaces, and more. Three-layer token architecture (primitive → semantic → component) configurable via CSS variables, compatible with light/dark themes.
- **Tailwind 4** — Pre-configured with Plex UI's design tokens so you can use utility classes that stay consistent with the component library.
- **35+ components** — Buttons, inputs, menus, selects, sidebars, date pickers, segmented controls, and more — built on Radix primitives for consistent accessibility and keyboard behavior.
- **467 icons** — A comprehensive icon library included out of the box.
- **Transitions** — Five transition primitives (Animate, AnimateLayout, AnimateLayoutGroup, SlotTransitionGroup, TransitionGroup) for polished motion.
- **14 hooks** — Dark mode, responsive breakpoints, media queries, and more.

### Quick start

Install the package and add the foundation styles to your app:

```bash
npm install @plexui/ui
```

In your global stylesheet (e.g. `main.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@plexui/ui/css";
@source "../node_modules/@plexui/ui";
```

Import your stylesheet before rendering, then use any component:

```tsx
import "./main.css";
import { Button } from "@plexui/ui/components/Button";

export function App() {
  return <Button color="primary">Get started</Button>;
}
```

For full setup (including optional router integration and provider), see [Installation](/docs/overview/installation).
