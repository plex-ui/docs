## Plex UI

A production-grade design system with Tailwind 4 styling, CSS variable design tokens, accessible components, and pixel-perfect Figma parity.

### Why Plex UI

**Production-grade.** These components are designed and tested for real products used at scale. Not theoretical, not designed in a vacuum.

**9 sizes, not 4.** Most libraries give you 3 or 4 size options. Plex UI has a unified 9-step scale (22px to 48px) across Button, Input, Select, SelectControl, and SegmentedControl. One `size` prop handles everything from dense dashboards to spacious landing pages.

**Figma-to-code parity.** Every size, color, and token exists identically in Figma and in React. No translation layer, no manual tweaks.

### What's included

- **Design tokens.** Three-layer architecture (primitive, semantic, component) via CSS variables. Light and dark themes out of the box.
- **Tailwind 4.** Pre-configured with Plex UI tokens so utility classes stay consistent with the component library.
- **Components.** Buttons, inputs, menus, selects, sidebars, date pickers, segmented controls, and more. Built on Radix primitives for accessibility and keyboard support.
- **Icons.** A comprehensive icon set included out of the box.
- **Transitions.** Five motion primitives for enter/exit animations and layout transitions.
- **Hooks.** Dark mode, responsive breakpoints, media queries, and other utilities.

### Quick start

Install the package and add the foundation styles to your app:

```bash
npm install @plexui/ui
```

In your global stylesheet (e.g. `main.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@plexui/ui/css";
@source "../node_modules/@plexui/ui";
```

Import your stylesheet before rendering, then use any component:

```tsx
import "./main.css";
import { Button } from "@plexui/ui/components/Button";

export function App() {
  return <Button color="primary">Get started</Button>;
}
```

For full setup (including optional router integration and provider), see [Installation](/docs/overview/installation).
