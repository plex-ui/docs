Figma now has an official Claude Code to Figma path (announced February 17, 2026).  
That is useful, but it is Claude-specific.

Figma Code↔Design Bridge follows a different principle:

- model-agnostic local API,
- direct editable node operations in Figma,
- two-way flow for design and code.

## What "ANY AI model" means in practice

If your model can call HTTP, it can work with Bridge:

- check connection state,
- send create/update commands,
- receive structured JSON responses.

No vendor lock-in to one assistant.

## Two-way flow: Design ↔ Code

Bridge is not just "code to screenshot".  
It works in both directions:

1. Code/AI → Figma: create and edit real nodes.
2. Figma → Code/AI: read structure and continue implementation from actual design state.

That is what makes iteration faster. You are not re-describing the UI every turn.

## Local API contract

Use the local endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:8867
```

Then:

```bash
GET /status
POST /command
```

Important:

- send command payload in `params` (not `args`),
- keep the plugin running in Figma while sending commands.

## 2-minute setup

1. In Figma: Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest.
2. Start bridge launcher:
   - macOS: `start-bridge.command`
   - Windows: `start-bridge.bat`
3. Give your model this instruction:

```bash
Figma Bridge API: http://localhost:8867
1) GET /status (connected=true)
2) POST /command with {"command":"...","params":{...}}
3) Use params, not args
```

## Why this workflow is faster

For production UI work, speed depends on loop latency, not one-shot generation quality.

Bridge reduces loop latency because:

- model can apply exact edits instead of re-generating whole screens,
- changes happen in the same Figma file your team already reviews,
- API shape is stable and explicit for automation.

## Pricing model

Current model is simple:

- one-time purchase,
- lifetime access,
- no subscription.
