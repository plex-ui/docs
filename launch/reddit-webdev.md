**Title:** Built a full design system (Figma + React) with 9 sizes per component

**Body:**

I've been working on Plex UI, a design system that covers both design and code.

**What it includes:**
- 35 React components (free, MIT licensed)
- Figma design system with 22,000+ variants (paid)
- 9 sizes per component (xs to 5xl)
- Three-layer token system
- 6,600+ icons
- Full parity between Figma and React

**The problem it solves:**
Most teams either use a Figma-only system (like Untitled UI) or a code-only library (like shadcn/ui). Designers and developers end up out of sync. Plex UI gives you both, built on the same token architecture.

```bash
npm install @plexui/ui
```

The React library is free. The Figma Kit is paid ($49-$299). Both are built to work with AI code editors (Claude, Cursor, Codex). Would love feedback if you try it out.
