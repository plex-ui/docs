**Title:** Plex UI: Figma & React Design System

**Tagline:** 22K variants, 9 sizes, built on Figma Variables

**Description:**

Most design systems take 3-6 months to build from scratch. You need tokens, components, documentation, and Figma files that actually match your code. By the time you're done, you could have shipped your product.

Plex UI gives you a complete design system out of the box. 35 components with 9 sizes each. 22,000+ Figma variants built entirely on Figma Variables. A three-layer token system (primitive → semantic → component) that makes theming actually work. 6,600+ icons. Full parity between Figma and React.

The React library is free and MIT licensed on npm (@plexui/ui). The Figma Kit is paid ($49-$299). Built for AI code editors like Claude, Cursor, and Codex. Start designing in Figma, export to code, and it just works.
