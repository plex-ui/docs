**Tweet 1:**
We built a design system with 22,000 Figma variants.

Every component has 9 sizes. Every token is a Figma Variable. Full Figma ↔ React parity.

Free React library. Here's what makes it different:

---

**Tweet 2:**
Most design systems give you 3-4 sizes per component.

Plex UI has 9 sizes. From xs to 3xl.

This matters because your app needs more flexibility than "small, medium, large."

---

**Tweet 3:**
Three-layer token system:
• Primitive tokens (raw values)
• Semantic tokens (contextual meaning)
• Component tokens (applied to UI)

All built as Figma Variables. Theme switching actually works.

---

**Tweet 4:**
The React library is free and MIT licensed.
npm install @plexui/ui

Built on Radix primitives and Tailwind CSS 4.
Designed for AI code editors (Claude, Cursor, Codex).

---

**Tweet 5:**
Figma Kit is paid ($49-$299).
35 components. 6,600+ icons. Everything syncs with code.

No more "design looks different from production."

---

**Tweet 6:**
Competitors like shadcn/ui have no Figma files.
Untitled UI has no React library.

Plex UI gives you both. Full system. Design to code in minutes.

GitHub: github.com/plex-ui/ui

React is free. Figma is paid. Both built for speed.
